<p>As per dictionary definition, Corporate security identifies and effectively mitigates or manages, at an early stage, any developments that may threaten the resilience and continued survival of a corporation. It is a business function which oversees and manages all the tasks of security, continuity and security within the businesses closely coordinated.</p>
<p>In this certification, WE combine Security, company priorities and best practices to answer the questions Who, What, Where, Why and How<br />Key Features.</p>
<ul>
<li>Addresses the often-conflicting goals of danger, protection, externalization between the security department and the remainder of the company</li>
<li>Shows security executives how company’s skill is developed in a company secure setting</li>
<li>Shows Security executives how to create company understanding in a setting of corporate security</li>
<li>Analysis of the management and communication skills required by the security officer</li>
<li>Focuses rather than security technology on simplicity, logic and creativity.</li>
<li>Shows the real difficulties of achieving Security in a profitable setting, and suggests methods of overcoming them</li>
<li>This shows the many Security methods and standards in a multitude of sectors</li>
<li>This includes case studies, glossary, objective chapter, debate issues and exercises.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>It is 3 days of focused insight into:</strong></p>
<p><strong>BUSINESS &amp; CORPORATE SECURITY MANAGEMENT</strong><br /><u>MODULES OF THE PROGRAM</u></p>
<ul>
<li>CORPORATE SECURITY TODAY</li>
<li>THREATS AND CHALLENGES</li>
<li>SECURITY MANAGMENT PRINCIPLES &amp; STRATEGIC STRUCTURES</li>
<li>ESPIONAGE: CORPORATE, INDUSTRIAL AND ECONOMIC</li>
<li>SUCCESS, FAILURE AND THE CONSEQUENCES</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CERTIFICATE IN SECURITY RISK &amp; CRISIS MANAGEMENT</strong><br /><u>MODULES OF THE TRAINING</u></p>
<ul>
<li>THREAT AND CHALLENGES</li>
<li>EMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSES</li>
<li>RISK MITIGATION, CONTINGENCIES AND COUNTERMEASURES</li>
<li>BUSINESS CONTINUITY / RESILIENCY</li>
<li>CRISIS MANAGEMENT</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WE highlight characteristics of alignment between security and the business:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The primary function of the security department is to persuade colleagues across the company to achieve ongoing Security through their day-to-day activities and choices.</li>
<li>The security department is involved in the leadership and not implementation of change and operates through trustworthy social networks.</li>
<li>Security is there to assist the company risk and not discourage it and should therefore be a leading player in the growth of new businesses.</li>
<li>Security reacts continually to fresh company issues, and as a result the portfolio and comparative significance of duties are changed over time. Security departments should never be stagnant or become stationary entities. Today, its function in many businesses is more about the general resilience of business than about’ traditional’ Security.</li>
<li>Security is both a strategic and a business endeavor, and departments need to differentiate between these two levels.</li>
<li>The Security services have authority and legitimacy not based on their know-how, but on their entrepreneurial proficiency, their abilities, their leadership capacity and communication skills.</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally, what comes in our mind? A Thief, an inquiry, a chase…. police, security and a case. Well that’s just one face of it, just like we can be hurt mentally, physically, financially. Similar Is the case with Crime.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Crime?</strong><br />Simply…. an action or omission which constitutes an offence and is punishable by law (dictionary meaning)<br />Crime is not only in physical appearance or between humans or of tangible objects. Theft of anything or any transaction without being shared with the concerned or the rightful owner is a crime. This can be in your domestic front or in your corporate environment. Industry might be any from Banking to Education from Defense to any regular civil job. Crime is possible anywhere.<br /><strong><br />Can anybody in the company/ existing set up be trusted to prevent it?</strong><br />NO. Its like confirming the damage.</p>
<p><strong>How to prevent it/ assess the loss/ catch the source?</strong><br />Only and only by a certified resource, a Certified Crime Prevention Specialist is the person who can assess the root cause and better still…. if included in the system from inception, can even prevent it completely as they have a proactive approach</p>
<p><strong>How do we reach out to one?</strong><br />You either contact the certification authority (in case if your presence is outside India), take a suggestion of such personnel and hire OR have a loyal and trustworthy resource from its own environment be trained and certified for Crime Prevention. The latter is a good option as the resource already holds a bias for the organization and will be a far better trusted option. However, hiring a trained professional from the authorized Body is also an extremely sensible approach to be included, as with this approach we do have a peace of mind that the resource offered is trusted by the trainers and is referred by the experts.</p>

<p><strong>What is CATS?</strong><br />Certified Anti-Terrorism Specialist. What is the image that we perceive from the term? A mask covered face, some grenades, and a rifle!!! Well, sad enough but that’s just one of the final phases just before the attack is ready to happen.</p>
<p>Terrorism can’t be handled when it is right there…. ready to give results, that’s when we see it but it needs to be killed much before when the masterminds like us are sitting between us in surroundings like ours and planning these attacks, the only difference is of the intention because their focus, grit, and determination is as it is very strong.</p>
<p>This is where this training and certification holds you better. The idea and intention of this certification is to produce a candidate/ personnel/ professional who can tap the crime in the initial stage. Here, the experts teach you or rather train you on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Global Terrorism Threats and Trends</li>
<li>Recent Terrorist Attacks: Case Study</li>
<li>Explosives and Its Effects</li>
<li>Improvised Explosive Device</li>
<li>Fundamentals of Anti and Counter-Terrorism Framework</li>
<li>Methods of Attack: Tactics, Techniques, and Procedure</li>
<li>The Process of An Operational Plan: The Attack Cycle</li>
<li>Ex Silent Whisper: Attacking and Defending a Target – Vulnerability Assessment</li>
<li>Managing IED Incidents</li>
<li>The Use of Internet and IT for Criminal, Terrorist, and Security Purposes</li>
<li>Exercise Swift Valor: Reacting to IED Incidents</li>
</ul>
<p>CATS attendees are trained at an unclassified level encompassing subjects in context to fraternities from both the Commercial and Law Enforcement sectors. It offers a wide structure to define similarities and differences between international terrorism and its strategic direction, its method of operating organizations in various areas and the application of tactics and techniques according to its skills and intentions. In brief, a synergistic concomitance of consistent variables in the field of terrorism is provided by this course in depth.</p>
<p>The course offers insights into ideology, finance, logistics, structure, network and cell connectivity within and outside the corresponding boundaries on the strategic and operational fronts. This knowledge will help analysts and security experts to understand patterns and trends and the changing danger in the next few years.</p>
<p>Tactics, Techniques, Procedures (TTP) will be centric subjects in the tactical sector. The main goal is to give participants sufficient understanding to prevent, recognize and handle danger through protective hardening measures in advance of expertise. For front-line respondents who are subjected to the risks on start, this skill is essential. Knowledge can also be used in the implementation of policies, assessments, and performance of penetration tests.</p>
<p>Explosive device (IEDs), IED techniques against a goal and the assessment of the target force and vulnerability are the key focus of the attack stages. Theoretical lessons are enhanced by debates and table-top exercises adapted to existing IED and terrorist situations.</p>
<p>At the end of this, we would like to confirm a strong point that Crime or Terrorism is always an anti-social attempt or a result. It’s better to be proactive and curb it rather than being reactive and suffering the loss and recovering… Be trained to sense it and stop it.</p>
